# EmaCartoon Portfolio Project

A portfolio of work is a collection of my best work that can showcase my skills and talents, as well as the thought processes behind it, to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. 

**Note:** As I am just starting to build my portfolio body of projects, there will be some placeholder images and names that I will switch out later on in my course. This note will be removed when I have updated my portfolio.

## Motivation / Project Criteria

AS A potential employee I WANT to have a potential employer view my deployed portfolio of work samples SO THAT they can review samples of my work and assess whether I'm a good candidate for their open position.

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
[x] THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
[X] THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
[X] THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
[X] THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
[X] THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
[X] THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


## Approach
This project utilizes a combination of HTML5, CSS3, Media Queries, and Flaxbox variables to achieve a webpage that will allow a potential employer view my work and get an idea of my capabilities, as well as find and contact me.


## Technology Used

CSS Flexbox framework, Google Fonts, and HTML 5.
